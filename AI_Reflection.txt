During this project I used ChatGPT-5 as a tool to help me in the development process. I tried to write and understood everything myself as I always do, but I also used AI in cases where i need write boilerplate code or also to ask it for help when I got stuck in some specific parts. 
Below I explain exactly where I used it and what changed.
---

1. Calendar (calendar.js)

I built the main calendar myself generating days, navigation, rendering, and for the most part it worked fine, but the weekday alignment was wrong: every month started with Monday as its first day which is not a real representation and i got stuck here for some time until i decided to ask ChatGPT for help.  
I pasted the calendar.js file and asked ChatGPT something like:  
> “can you check why my calendar always starts on monday? the first day is always wrong”

It looked through my code and explained that getDay() in JavaScript starts counting from Sunday as 0.
That was the reason my offset was wrong. It showed me how to shift the days correctly, and after trying a few small edits, I ended up replacing that part with:
```js
const firstDayIndex = (days[0].getDay() + 6) % 7;
```
Later, I also wanted to show multiple sports per day instead of one color dot. I asked AI for ideas, and it suggested grouping events by sport and rendering colored dots. I rewrote that part myself but based on that idea.

2. Event Details (eventDetails.js)

At first, whenever I clicked on a day that had only one event, it still showed a list instead of opening the event details directly.  
I asked AI:
> “when clicking a date with one event it still shows a list, how can i fix this?”

AI suggested splitting the code into two functions one for a single event and one for multiple.  
So I made:
- `renderSingleEvent()` for one event
- `renderEventDetails()` for lists

Then added:
```js
if (dayEvents.length === 1) {
  renderSingleEvent(app, dayEvents[0], events);
  return;
}
```
This fixed it the problem that i was having, and at the same time also made the code easier to read and understand .

3. Add Event Form (addEventForm.js)

I already knew what fields I wanted (sport, date, teams, goals, etc.), but I didn’t want to waste time typing all the HTML structure manually.  
So I asked AI for a clean form layout with grid, labels, and buttons. It generated a base version that I edited to match what i wanted it to look like.  
I wrote all validation, event object creation, and saving to localStorage myself.

4. Project structure and docs

AI helped me think about the folder layout (`src/modules`, `src/tests`, etc.) and write a first draft for the README.  
I later simplified and rewrote both to sound more like my own writing.

In general I ask AI a lot of questions when I am working on something, and to me it is a very useful tool that i have learned to use responsibly.
I have learned Javascript before we had access to tools like ChatGPT, so i believe that i have a strong foundation and understandment of code and domain in general.
Now i try to use it mostly when i want to save myself time with writing the code but not about thinking about it, i try to use my brain as much as possible and come up with the solutions myself, but when there is boilerplate code that needs to be written i prefer to use AI to speed this process up, and thats what I also did in some parts of this project.
